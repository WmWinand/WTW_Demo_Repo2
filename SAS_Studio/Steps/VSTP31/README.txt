Once you have downloaded the ZIP file containing the course files, follow these steps to set up your SAS Studio environment:

1. Download course data from the Extended Learning Page
	a. In the Course Materials section, download Course Data. This downloads a zip file named VSTP31.zip.
	b. Unzip the file on your local computer. This creates a folder VSTP31 with the course data, programs, and the VSTP31.json file.

2. Import course content
	a. In the upper left corner, click the Applications menu button and select Manage Environment. SAS Environment Manager opens. 
	b. In the left pane, click Import.
	c. For the Source step, next to the Import file field, click the Select a package file button.
	d. Navigate to the location where you unzipped the file (VSTP31).
	e. In the VSTP31 folder, select VSTP31.json and click Open.
	   NOTE: The course content will be imported to the Courses/VSTP folder. If this folder structure does not exist, it will be created during import. If you want to change the location of the course content, you can do so after the import is complete.
	f. Click the Mapping step, then click Import. When the files have finished importing, a message appears: Import job has completed.
	g. In the left pane, click Content. Navigate to SAS Content/Courses to view the VSTP folder. Confirm VSTP contains the subfolders activities, demos, practices, and solutions. 

3. Verify that you have access to the CARS and SHOES SAS data tables in the SASHELP library.
